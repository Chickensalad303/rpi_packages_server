make website with ajax auto get newest data

make app store latest ip input in localstorage, right now every time you 
close and open again you have to type ip in again. ==> use shared_preferences in flutter


UPDATE: this is kinda done for now:

make server console.log its ip adress, so you don't need access to router to get ip adress

create settings menu inside app to edit ip adress.

inside the flutter app impliment the settings (right now gui works but does nutting)
